## 1. Project Overview  
This project aims to develop a machine-learning model to **predict the likelihood of diabetes** in individuals based on clinical, demographic and lifestyle data. The goal is to assist early detection, risk stratification and preventive healthcare planning.

Key points:  
- Classification problem (binary: diabetic vs non-diabetic)  
- Uses publicly available dataset (e.g., Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset) or institution-provided dataset  
- Applies data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, deployment

## 2. Motivation  
- Diabetes mellitus (especially type 2) is a major global health concern with rising prevalence and significant complications if undetected early.  
- Early prediction can help individuals and healthcare providers to take preventive actions.  
- Machine learning offers scalable ways to uncover patterns and risk factors from data.

## 3. Dataset & Features  
**Dataset:**  
-Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset (768 samples, 8 features) or a custom dataset.  
- Format: .csv 
**Features include:**  
- Number of pregnancies  
- Plasma glucose concentration  
- Blood pressure  
- Skin thickness  
- Insulin level  
- BMI (Body Mass Index)  
- Diabetes pedigree function (family history)  
- Age  

**Target variable:**  
- `Outcome` column (0 = non-diabetic, 1 = diabetic)
